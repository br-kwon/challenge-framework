# Khan Academy Javascript Project

#### Technologies
jQuery, Node.js, Express, Ace Editor, Esprima

I chose Esprima as the parser because of its clean and robust documentation. Though Acorn is slightly faster on several browsers, I felt that the scope of this project does not require heavy parsing duties.

#### Install
`npm install` to install all necessary node_modules

#### Run
* `node server/server.js` from the main directory to run the server.
* configs are set to 'http://localhost:8000'
